# random-stars

Continuously draws colorful star shapes at random points on the screen using
a simple graphics library once ubiquituous on DOS PCs in the 80s and early 90s.
Tiny stars grow to a random size.

Compiles on DOS (and DosBox) using Borland Graphics Interface (BGI)
or on Linux using SDL_bgi, a modern clone which implements most of the original
library with calls to SDL2. See http://libxbgi.sourceforge.net for details.
