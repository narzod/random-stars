# random-stars

Continuously draws colorful star shapes at random points on the screen using
a simple graphics library once ubiquituous on DOS PCs. Tiny stars grow to a
random size.

Compiles on DOS (and DosBox) using Borland Graphics Interface (BGI)
or a modern port for Linux, such as SDL_bgi.

(SDL_big downloads and compile info available at http://libxbgi.sourceforge.net/.)
