# random-stars

Continuously draws colorful star shapes at random points on the screen using
a simple graphics library once ubiquituous on DOS PCs in the 80s and early 1990s.
Tiny stars grow to a random size.

Compiles on DOS (and DosBox) using Borland Graphics Interface (BGI)
or a modern port for Linux, such as SDL_bgi, which implements most of the original calls with SDL2.

(SDL_bgi,nloads and compile info available at http://libxbgi.sourceforge.net/.)
